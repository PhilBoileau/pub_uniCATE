This repository is organized as follows:

- `simulations/`: materials for reproducing the simulation study
- `analysis/`: materials for reproducing the clinical trial analysis (data not included)

The preprint will be made available on arXiv shortly. The accompanying R package, `uniCATE`, is available on GitHub at [github.com/insightsengineering/uniCATE](https://github.com/insightsengineering/uniCATE).
